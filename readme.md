___

# Requirements:
We developed project using PyGad library. Though there are other dependencies for image processing like gari, imageio.

All these requirements are in `requirement.txt` file.

---

# Instruction to run the code:

Firstly, install all the required packages using following command. <br>
`python -m pip install -r requirement.txt`

Then, to run the code. Type following command at terminal. <br>
`python Project.py`

That command will take files from `input` folder which are target files to be generated.

___

## Notes:
The program takes a very very long time to run because it runs for *20000* generations. The smaller files such as `Mickey` produces
the results relatively faster.
